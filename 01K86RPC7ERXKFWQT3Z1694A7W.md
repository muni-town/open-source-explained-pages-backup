Openness according to software developers
-----------------------------------------

In the world of computer code and software development, we contribute most commonly to The Commons by making our computer code _open source_. That means we are sharing the _source_ – the inner workings – of our computer program, out in the _open_, for anyone to look at and remix.

This enables us to understand and change how our many digital and physical gadgets work. And when our gadgets are increasingly in control of our lives, this is a big deal.

The communities that have formed around computer code and its resulting software applications have become quite advanced in their discourse on ‘openness’, in large part because clear definitions of openness in code has major business applications $$$.

Thus, we’ve got specifications and protocols that describe varying degrees of openness in software, so that we may all collaborate with ease and move fast. It has made our industry [eat up the whole world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), nations and all.

The vast majority of software companies are built on the foundations provided by open source code. But most of these companies are profit-first rather than [value-first](https://bcorporation.net/). For the opportunists and profiteers, their involvement in open source practices is merely coincidental, not out of a sense of obligation to The Commons.

They’re not about progress for all, they’re just about progress for themselves.

_~_ [_African proverb_](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/30/487925796/it-takes-a-village-to-determine-the-origins-of-an-african-proverb?t=1611658165696)

People in tech still have **a lot** to learn about openness as an innately human, emotional trait. Most of us got unusually comfortable with machines exactly because we had an easier time making sense of 1s and 0s than our selves and fellow human beings with our soft, squishy innards.

There’s a lot you shouldn’t learn from software developers. Most things in fact. But the practice of open source as it applies to your life and the world around you is a conceptual understanding you don’t want to be without.
