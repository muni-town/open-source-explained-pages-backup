What is open source?
====================

The term ‘open source’ started in software development, but it is applicable to anything. If a _thing_ is open source, first and foremost it means you have access to its _source code_ — what makes that thing tick.

If a thing is open source, it means that the source code of that thing is openly available for insight and editing, and may even be copied, repurposed and shared with others under certain conditions.

Here is an open source recipe for making popcorn:

1.  Put some cooking oil in a thin and shallow pot
    
2.  Bring it to medium heat
    
3.  Put a handful of dried corn into the pot
    
4.  Gradually increase heat until the corn starts popping
    
5.  Add any flavoring of your choice
    

This is a recipe _code_ explaining how to produce a type of food, coded by outlining its production process. The self-contained piece of code in the above example is intended for humans; I wouldn’t yet trust a robot with plain-english instructions for something this hazardous.

Everything in our knowable world is made up of some type of code, it’s not just computer programs:

*   Our music is composed of note codes.
    
*   Our judicial system is made up of legal codes.
    
*   Our government is a big ol’ pile of bureaucratic codes.
    
*   Our educational institutions abide by pedagogical codes.
    
*   Our DNA is one long genetic code.
    

Defining open source
--------------------

Most dictionaries will give the impression that open source (sometimes written open-source) as a concept exists primarily for software, but as I’ll show later the praxis of open source co-creation and _commoning_ is multi-disciplinary and not limited to any specific industry or discipline.

I did find one dictionary-definition that I liked:

> [‘**open-source**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/open-source) [’ on Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/open-source):
> 
> _adjective_
> 
> 1.  (…)
>     
> 2.  pertaining to or denoting a product or system whose origins, formula, design, etc., are freely accessible to the public.
>     

_Closed source_ is the conceptual opposite of open source:

> [‘**closed source**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/closed-source) [’ on Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/closed-source):
> 
> _noun_
> 
> 1.  intellectual property, esp computer source code, that is not made available to the general public by its creators.
>     

In other words the inner workings of closed-source products are completely opaque and belong strictly to the people who made them, whereas open-source products are fully inspectable and collectively owned.
