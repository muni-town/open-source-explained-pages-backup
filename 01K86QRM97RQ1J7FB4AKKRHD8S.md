What is open source?
====================

The term ‘open source’ started in software development, but it is applicable to anything. If a _thing_ is open source, first and foremost it means you have access to its _source code_ — what makes that thing tick.

If a thing is open source, it means that the source code of that thing is available for insight and editing, and may even be copied, repurposed and shared with others under certain conditions.

Here is an open source recipe for making popcorn:

*   Put some cooking oil in a thin and shallow pot
    
*   Bring it to medium heat
    
*   Put a handful of dried corn into the pot
    
*   Gradually increase heat until the corn starts popping
    
*   Add any flavoring of your choice
    

That is a food recipe _code_. Everything in our knowable world is made up of some type of code, it’s not just computer programs:

Our music is composed of note codes.

Our judicial system is made up of legal codes.

Our government is a big ol’ pile of bureaucratic codes.

Our educational system abides by pedagogical codes.

Our DNA is one long genetic code.

Most dictionaries will give the impression that open source as a concept exists primarily for software, but that would be a massive waste of its potential. I did find one that I liked:

> [‘**open-source**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/open-source) [’ on Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/open-source):
> 
> _adjective_
> 
> 1.  (…)
>     
> 2.  pertaining to or denoting a product or system whose origins, formula, design, etc., are freely accessible to the public.
>     

_Closed source_ is the conceptual opposite of open source:

> [‘**closed source**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/closed-source) [’ on Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/closed-source):
> 
> _noun_
> 
> 1.  intellectual property, esp computer source code, that is not made available to the general public by its creators.
>     

In other words, closed-source products belong strictly to the people who made them, whereas open-source products exemplify various forms of collective ownership.
