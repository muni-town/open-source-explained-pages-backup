Unconditional giving
====================

> _Unconditional love is not fully possible. Unconditional love is the necessary, dream-like, and invisible shoreline that continually draws us to its edge but where we can never fully arrive. (…)_
> 
> _The only path possible is to give our self unconditionally to the conditionality of each overwhelming, disturbing and rewarding guise of love._

~ [David Whyte](https://davidwhyte.com/)

At its most basic, open source is a great delivery mechanism. Making something free – in the widest sense possible – is the best way to get your product in front of people, whether it’s a thing or a thought or something else entirely.

**At its very best, open source is our honest attempt at unconditional love, as part of a** [**gift economy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy)**.** There can be a great number of other motivations involved, like skill improvement, resume building, professional networking, making friends.., but one of the motivations mixed in there is the act of giving, and doing so unconditionally.

You get to say:

_Here you go world, have some unconditional love._

_To whoever’s heart is warmed by this humble gift:_

_I’m glad my free bits of love found someone._

This act of unconditional gifting induces a feeling everyone should experience. It can warm and sustain a heart through cold winters.

> Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It's not 'I love you' for this or that reason, not 'I love you if you love me.' It's love for no reason, love without an object.
