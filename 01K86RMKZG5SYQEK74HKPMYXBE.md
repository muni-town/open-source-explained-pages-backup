The Commons
===========

> The commons is a new way to express a very old idea—that some forms of wealth belong to all of us, and that these community resources must be actively protected and managed for the good of all.

Our open source things, knowledge and relationships are all part of the the _great commons_ that makes up our shared, non-individuated world.

The Digital Library of the Commons defines "commons" as:

> "a general term for shared resources in which each stakeholder has an equal interest"

The Commons is the big, bottomless bag of _things and the connections between things_ in the world that we all steward together in shared ownership. I like to occasionally write it capitalized because it deserves the same legitimacy we give to our physical cities and countries; in fact it supercedes them all.

Back in the Stone Age, the vast majority of _stuff_ only existed as a commons. Today it is no longer the default. Everything has been divided up as people’s property, some with obscenely much more than others. Now even the social ties between people, our social networks, are safe from corporate enclosures.

Because of this grossly uneven distribution it’s hard not to perceive the world in terms of scarcity rather than abundance. The haves and the have-nots. If you live in a world of scarcity, it makes sense to carefully guard any _thing_ you have that can be considered valuable.

This is where software and the internet revolution performs one of the greatest magic tricks in history, by making certain forms of value creation incredibly cost-effective and scalable.

> If you’re coming to the commons for the first time, it can be difficult to grok the idea because there are so many different ways to understand the commons.  That’s because the commons is not so much a fixed, universal thing as a general concept describing durable, dynamic sets of social relationships for managing resources -- all sorts of resources:  digital, urban, natural, indigenous, rural, cultural, scientific, to use some crude categories.

> Each commons has its own distinctive character because each is shaped by its particular location, history, culture and social practices.  So it can be hard for the newcomer to see the patterns of “commoning.” The term _commoning_ means to suggest that the commons is really more of a verb than a noun.  It is a set of ongoing practices, not an inert physical resource.  There is no commons without _commoning_.  This helps explain why the commons is different from a "public good"; the commons is not just an economistic category floating in the air without actual people.  There are no commons without _commoners._
> 
> Getting a grip on the commons can be difficult, too, because there is no definitive canon of works. The particular commons that you inhabit and participate in will shape your view of what perspectives are noteworthy and explanatory. A commoner in Africa will see the commons in a different light than a European or an Asian or an American.  Context matters.  That's why a universal, unitary "defintion" of the commons is problematic.  The phenomena of the commons are so segmented and fractal -- yet related!

> As this suggests, there is no substitute for spending a little time exploring the commons from many different angles. The concept cannot be understood in one sound bite.
