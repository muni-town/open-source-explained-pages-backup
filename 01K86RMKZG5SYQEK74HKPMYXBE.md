The Commons
===========

> The commons is a new way to express a very old idea—that some forms of wealth belong to all of us, and that these community resources must be actively protected and managed for the good of all. ~[_source_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240412091700/https://www.onthecommons.org/about-commons)

Our open source things, knowledge and relationships are all part of the the _great commons_ that constitutes our shared, non-individuated world. Anything that is open source (_adjective_) is a part of the commons, and by open sourcing (_verb_) an artifact you have effectively committed it to the commons.

> Scholars such as [David Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey "David Harvey") have adopted the term **_commoning_**, which as a verb serves to emphasize an understanding of the commons as a process and a practice rather than as "a particular kind of thing" or static entity. Some authors distinguish between the resources shared (the _common-pool resource_s), the _community_ who governs it, and _commoning_, that is, the process of coming together to manage such resources. Commoning thus adds another dimension to the commons, acknowledging the social practices entailed in the process of establishing and governing a commons. These practices entail, for the community of commoners, the creation of a new way of living and acting together, thus involving a collective psychological shift: it also entails a process of subjectivization, where the commoners produce themselves as common subjects.

Think of The Commons as the vast collection of _things and the connections between things_ in the world that we all steward together in shared ownership. I like to occasionally write it capitalized because it deserves the same legitimacy we give to our physical cities and countries; in fact it supercedes them all.

Back in the Stone Age, the vast majority of _stuff_ only existed as a commons; people could only own something insofar as they could reach out and touch it. Today the commons is no longer the default. Everything has been divided up as people’s property, some with obscenely much more than others. Not even the social ties between persons, i.e. our social networks, are safe from corporate enclosures.

Because of this grossly uneven distribution it’s hard not to perceive the world in terms of scarcity rather than abundance. The haves and the have-nots. If you live in a world of scarcity, it makes sense to carefully guard any _thing_ you have in your posession that can be considered valuable.

This is where software and the internet revolution performs one of the greatest magic tricks in history, by making certain forms of value creation incredibly cost-effective and scalable.

Digital Commons
---------------

The commons that I understand best is the digital software commons, so that’ll be our primary case study throughout the book. Two decades ago software would have been an unnecessarily nerdy entrypoint for understanding the implications of open source praxis, but software has since “eaten the world”, enveloping it in a digital membrane that leaves no life untouched.

To navigate the modern world is to navigate through software, most of it with unnecessarily strict [prescriptions](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/prescriptive-technologies) for how we ought to conduct ourselves. To be an advocate of the digital commons extends far beyond openly licensed computer software and into [liberatory technology](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/lewis-herber-murray-bookchin-towards-a-liberatory-technology).

This sub-section from the [Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons) page on Wikipedia goes several layers deeper into our common cause as commoners:

> [Mayo Fuster Morell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Fuster_Morell) proposed a definition of digital commons as "information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity. Additionally, the community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes and of their shared resources."
> 
> Examples of digital commons are Wikipedia, free software and open-source hardware projects.
> 
> Following the narrative of post-growth, the digital commons can present a model of progress that guide commoners to build counter-power in the economic and political field. Being able to digitally share knowledge and resources through internet platforms is a new capacity that challenges the traditional hierarchical structures of production, allowing for a higher collective benefit and a sustainable management of resources.
> 
> Non-material resources are digitally reproducible and therefore can be shared at a low cost, contrary to physical resources which are quite limited. Shared resources represent in this context data, information, culture and knowledge which are produced and accessible online. In accordance with the "design global, manufacture local" approach digital commons may link the traditional commons theory with existing physical infrastructures. It further connects with the degrowth communities since transformations in use-value creation by employing new technologies, decoupling society from GDP growth and lower carbon dioxide emissions, are envisioned.
> 
> Moreover, as a decentralized approach, there is a strong emphasis on inclusion and democratic regulation which has led Commons as an alternative, emancipatory and emerging form of social organization that goes beyond democratic capitalism. Accordingly, **through the cooperation of diverse stakeholders and the equitable distribution of means of production, technological development becomes more accessible and bottom-up projects are fostered in communities**

For more on the commons I recommend David Bollier’s Thinking Like a Commoner, second edition (2025). It will be repeatedly quoted throughout this book.

On his website, David introduces newcomers as follows:

> New to the Commons?
> -------------------
> 
> If you’re coming to the commons for the first time, it can be difficult to grok the idea because there are so many different ways to understand the commons.  That’s because the commons is not so much a fixed, universal thing as a general concept describing durable, dynamic sets of social relationships for managing resources -- all sorts of resources:  digital, urban, natural, indigenous, rural, cultural, scientific, to use some crude categories.
> 
> Each commons has its own distinctive character because each is shaped by its particular location, history, culture and social practices.  So it can be hard for the newcomer to see the patterns of “commoning.” The term _commoning_ means to suggest that the commons is really more of a verb than a noun.  It is a set of ongoing practices, not an inert physical resource.  There is no commons without _commoning_.  This helps explain why the commons is different from a "public good"; the commons is not just an economistic category floating in the air without actual people.  There are no commons without _commoners._
> 
> Getting a grip on the commons can be difficult, too, because there is no definitive canon of works. The particular commons that you inhabit and participate in will shape your view of what perspectives are noteworthy and explanatory. A commoner in Africa will see the commons in a different light than a European or an Asian or an American.  Context matters.  That's why a universal, unitary "defintion" of the commons is problematic.  The phenomena of the commons are so segmented and fractal -- yet related!  
> 
> As this suggests, there is no substitute for spending a little time exploring the commons from many different angles. The concept cannot be understood in one sound bite.
